			<h2>Year at Lewis: [I transferred this previous fall semester and I'm currently a junior]</h2>
			<h2>Lewis major/minor/concentrations: [I am a mathematics major]</h2>
			<h2>Reasons for pursuing this degree: [I was undecided for the entire duration before I transferred but I had been tutoring math courses since returning to college. While transferring I applied to be a math tutor at Lewis which was the kick in the head to pursue more about the field of mathematics.]</h2>

            <h2>Reasons for Taking This Course</h2>
            <p>[I had a pre requisite waved for an upperlevel math course where some programming background would have been helpful. Since I knew it would be beneficial and I enrolled into this course.]</p>

            <h2>Hobbies and Special Interests</h2>
            <p>[I enjoy reading epic fantasy (I reread almost 12 out of the 14 book series "Wheel of Time" over the summer) and some nonfiction pieces sprinkled in. I also enjoy maintaining an above average level of fitness as I've gotten older through multiple modalities such as running, swimming, yoga, and weight lighting to name the most prominate ones. I am also an avid anime watcher and miss when anime episodes were drawn by different artist like DragonBall Z.]</p>

            <p>[I don't have anything particular "fun" about myself outside of having an unusual background and perspective. I'm licensed as a massage therapist in the state of Illinois and was a teaching assistant for massage therapy at the age of 19.]</p>
